The following videos give an overview of our project and goals:

## Problem
To replicate the Deep Structural Causal Models for Tractable Counterfactual Inference[1]paper , and apply it to google cartoon faces dataset[3] and answer counterfactual queries on the same. 

We aim to explicitly model causal relationships with a fully specified causal models with no unobserved confounding and inferring exogenous noise via  normalising flows.

Our goal is to validate our causal assumptions; if our causal assumptions are valid, these simulations should align with our imagination.



## How to run the project
import causalfairness
